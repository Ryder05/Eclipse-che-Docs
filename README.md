2) Eclipse Che comes with pre-defined devfiles samples out-of-the-box made for testing purposes. But you enter a link to git repo and in this case eclipse-che will either uses an existing devfile if it is defined within the reposory else creating a defvile on his own.
In our case, opencellers can find here a devfile registrey where there is pre-defined devfiles for confugring various develoment environments.
